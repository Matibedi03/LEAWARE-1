# AI-Native Blazor Starter

Small Blazor Server project created to practice Clean Architecture
and conscious usage of AI tools during development.

## Tech stack
- .NET
- Blazor Server
- Clean Architecture (Domain / Application / Infrastructure)
- AI-assisted development (ChatGPT, Cursor)

## AI mindset
AI was used as a programming assistant, not a source of blind copy-paste.
Generated code was reviewed, validated and improved.

## Example fix
AI-generated logic initially missed input validation.
I added defensive checks and simplified the logic
to prevent runtime errors and invalid state.

## Goal
Learn architecture, understand why code works,
and build good habits early as a junior developer.
